Syma-107-SparkCore
==================

Syma 107 RC control with any DirectX DirectInput device over UDP local connection


Connect (+) of IR LED to 5Vcc.

Connect (-) to pin 4 with a 39 Ohm resistor in line.  For best results make a transistor circuit with external power source or use USB power.


Hardware used:
==================
Spark Core 1.0

IR LED 5mm (tested with both 940nm and 950nm)

Rr = 39 Ohm Resistor for IR LED



For much much higher transmit distance use transistor!


Tested with:
==================

BC548B transistor

Rt = 2700 Ohm (for 5V, 1600 Ohm for 3.3V)
